# About the Project

In this project, a static webpage was converted to a mobile-ready web application. Firstly, the responsiveness to different widths of screen was added, so that the website worked well in the desktop screen, tablet and mobile phone. Then, the accessibility was implemented in it, which made the website become accessible to people with disabilities. Lastly, the service worker allowed the site to be accessible even office, duo to the cache stored.

# How to Run the Website

1. Firstly, have a version of Python installed. In the folder of the project, start up a HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local machine.
   . In the terminal, run python -v to know which version of Python is installed. Then run python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (for python 2) or python3 -m http.server 8000 (for python 3).

2. With the server running, visit http://localhost:8000 and the website should already be running.
